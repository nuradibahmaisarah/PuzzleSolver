Data Science, Al, Game Development, and Cybersecurity). Each engineer works on exactly
two projects, and each project category is represented at least once.

Here are the clues:
1. Alex works on Game Development but not on Web Development.
2. Bella is involved in Al but not Cybersecurity.
3. The Cybersecurity project is handled by Chris, who also works on Web Development.
4. Diana does not work on Al but is involved in Data Science.
5. Eric handles Game Development and Cybersecurity but not Data Science.
6. Bella does not work on Data Science.
7. The Al project involves two engineers.

Task: Determine which engineer works on which projects
